        "The control problem of rigid body attitude redirection with attitude constraints and the fault-tolerant control problem of actuator faults have been extensively investigated individually. However, the challenge remains in addressing the rigid body attitude redirection problem under initial attitude violation constraints and a finite sequence of actuator faults. Finite sequential actuator faults can compromise system controllability or induce system instability, while violations of attitude constraints may result in equipment damage or mission failure. Therefore, this paper aims to address the spacecraft attitude redirection problem under mixed attitude constraints with arbitrary initial attitudes and a finite sequence of actuator faults. By leveraging the SO(3) framework, we establish the mathematical model for attitudes and error functions as well as define the mathematical constraint set for the mixed attitude constraint region. Additionally, we construct a potential function based on logarithmic barriers to facilitate spacecraft redirection while satisfying both forbidden and mandatory attitude constraints. Considering the initial attitude of the spacecraft being contrary to the constraints, we propose a potential function with switching characteristics to accommodate any initial attitude. Additionally, we introduce a hysteresis switching function to smoothen the switching process and minimize control chattering. To address the challenge posed by finite sequence actuator faults, an adaptive actuator fault direct compensation matrix is designed to mitigate their impact. By incorporating a logarithmic potential function into the backstepping controller, we present an arbitrary initial mixed attitude constraints adaptive fault-tolerant controller that ensures stability and effectiveness in dealing with aforementioned constraints and faults. Simulation results validate the applicability of our proposed controller for spacecraft attitude redirection tasks under mixed attitude constraints with arbitrary initial attitudes and finite sequence actuator faults. These studies not only emphasize its energy consumption efficiency but also affirm its robustness against external disturbances and measurement noise.",

          content: `Over the past few decades, the development of rigid-body attitude control systems has been instrumental in propelling advancements across a spectrum of fields, including spacecraft, aviation, and robotics. Scholars have delved into a multitude of sophisticated control algorithms tailored for nonlinear attitude control. Notable among these are adaptive control [1], [2], backstepping control [3], [4], inverse optimal control [5], [6], sliding mode control [7], [8], and fault-tolerant control [9], [10].
                                Despite significant progress, conventional control methodologies often overlook the attitude constraints inherent in real-world applications. There is a burgeoning interest in examining the maneuvering of rigid bodies within specific, scenario-driven constraints. For example, airborne optical telescopes must avoid bright fields of view to prevent damage to their sensitive instruments [11]. Similarly, the orientation of a communication antenna must remain within its beamwidth to sustain a connection with a ground station. These operational constraints on rigid-body attitudes are characterized as attitude constraints. Expanding the constraint region not only limits the permissible attitude range but also complicates the trajectory of attitude maneuvers and the control system’s complexity. In recent years, several researchers have explored the challenge of attitude maneuvering under such constraints. In [12], path planning strategies that chart a rotational trajectory meeting specific criteria are proposed. In contrast, the potential function approach simplifies computations and is amenable to on-board processing. It leverages artificial potential functions to guide the system towards attitude-conforming paths, assigning lower potential energy to the desired attitude and imposing higher potential energy barriers within constrained regions.
                                The exponential obstacle potential function, as introduced by [13], represents multiple attitude constraints based on attitude unit quaternions. Concurrently, [14] developed an attitude stabilizer that adheres to dual constraints of attitude and angular rate, facilitating spacecraft reorientation while accounting for prohibited zones and maximum angular velocities. Additionally, the concept of nullifiable potential functions, complete with a cautionary distance, was proposed by [15] to manage attitude and obstacle-avoidance limitations. The attitude controller presented by [16] represents the spacecraft’s attitude using the SO(3) group, circumventing the singularities and ambiguities associated with unit quaternion and Euler angle representations. Along these lines, [17] proposed an adaptive saturated attitude controller based on SO(3) to achieve consensus and tracking in multi-spacecraft systems under mixed constraints, even with arbitrary initial attitudes. It is important to note that while these studies have successfully managed attitude maneuvers across various regions, they have not considered the impact of actuator faults.
                                Actuator faults, which can diminish controllability or even destabilize a system [18], [19], are often neglected in the context of spacecraft attitude control under multiple constraints. The existing fault-tolerant strategies are typically divided into passive and active approaches [20]. Given the complexity and potential latency of active schemes, this paper focuses on passive fault tolerance. Scholars have proposed diverse strategies, such as 
                                theory [21], [22], Lyapunov reconstruction [23], [24], and sliding mode control [25], to achieve fault tolerance. Building on sliding mode techniques, [26] introduced an attitude controller for flexible spacecraft with redundant actuators. Furthermore, an adaptive fault-tolerant approach was employed by [27] to develop a controller that mitigates the effects of actuator faults. Additionally, [28] proposed a data-driven adaptive control method based on supervised learning to accurately predict continuous nonlinear actuator faults and model uncertainties. Lastly, [29] proposed a fault-tolerant attitude control strategy that incorporates both attitude constraints and actuator faults to ensure successful spacecraft maneuvering.
                                However, the literature is scarce regarding the simultaneous consideration of multiple attitude constraints and finite sequential actuator faults in attitude maneuvering. This paper introduces an adaptive fault-tolerant backstepping controller integrated with a potential function, adeptly addressing both challenges. The proposed controller facilitates real-time computation of the fault compensation matrix under actuator faults while ensuring the spacecraft’s attitude adheres to constraints. The system’s asymptotic stabilization is demonstrated through rigorous numerical simulations.
                                The primary contribution of this paper lies in its holistic approach to multiple attitude constraints and finite sequential actuator faults, setting it apart from prior works such as [30], [31]. Unlike these studies, which focus on either attitude constraints or actuator faults in isolation or with limited scope, our method integrates an adaptive fault-tolerant controller based on an artificial potential function for attitude constraints and an adaptive direct compensation mechanism for finite sequential actuator faults. The hybrid attitude potential function presented not only accommodates any initial attitude but also demonstrates superior gradient descent performance compared to [17]. It also effectively minimizes control chattering through the smooth hysteresis loop transition. Additionally, we provide a stability analysis grounded in Lyapunov theory to substantiate the stability of the closed-loop system.
                                The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the kinematics of rigid body attitude using SO(3) representations. The dynamics of attitude under finite sequential actuator faults are then derived. Subsequently, the mixed attitude constraints model is described, and the research problem is stated. Section 3 introduces the potential function for mixed attitude constraints, details the design of the adaptive fault-tolerant backstepping controller, and offers a comprehensive stability analysis. Section 4 presents numerical simulation results that validate the efficacy of our proposed controller. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our conclusions.`,

          content: `In this paper, we address the problem of spacecraft attitude redirection under mixed attitude constraints with arbitrary initial attitudes and finite sequential actuator faults. Firstly, utilizing the SO(3) framework to express the attitude and error function, we describe the mathematical constraint sets for both forbidden and mandatory attitude regions. Subsequently, a potential function with adaptable switching characteristics is constructed to reorient the spacecraft while satisfying these constraints. Additionally, a hysteresis switching function is incorporated to smoothen the switching process and reduce control chattering. Furthermore, an adaptive actuator fault direct compensation matrix is designed to mitigate challenges posed by finite sequences of actuator faults. By coupling a logarithmic potential function with a backstepping controller, an adaptive fault-tolerant controller for arbitrary initial mixed attitude constraints is proposed in order to ensure stability and effectiveness in dealing with the aforementioned constraints and faults. Simulation results validate the applicability of this proposed controller in spacecraft attitude redirection tasks under mixed attitude constraints with arbitrary initial attitudes as well as finite sequential actuator faults. Moving forward, our future research endeavors will be dedicated to developing attitude control techniques capable of adapting to parameter uncertainties within systems that encompass flexible components. Additionally, priority will be given to underactuated systems particularly susceptible to complete actuator faults aiming at augmenting resilience and dependability of spacecraft control systems in adverse conditions.`,
