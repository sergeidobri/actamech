            </li>
            <li>

              </span>

            <li>
              refer to the reproduced material without the reference to the

            </li>
            <li>
              reject manuscripts that undergone unnecessary deliberate
              fragmentation with the aim of submitting them as several
              autonomous manuscripts;
            </li>
            <li>
              be aware that abstracts or pre-prints for academic events do not
              interfere with submitting the corresponding research for its
              further publication;
            </li>
            <li>
              ensure open access to the article after it has been approved for
              publication;
            </li>
            <li>
              notify authors (research teams) within several days upon
              acceptance of the manuscript;
            </li>
            <li>
              arrange for competent, honest and prompt review of submitted
              manuscripts;
            </li>
            <li>
              post on-line the information provided by the author about research
              funding;
            </li>
            <li>
              ensure there are no semantic, grammatical, stylistic or any other
              mistakes upon acceptance of the article;
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              bear in mind that reviews on the submitted manuscript are
              confidential and the disclosure of their content as well as
              reviewers` names to the third party is unacceptable;
            </li>
            <li>
              request an inquiry into the breach of ethical publication policies
              (regardless whether manuscripts are published or not) by an
              editor, author or reviewer where they are required to provide
              explanations;
            </li>
            <li>
              store the evidence related to the breach of publication ethics
              policy defined in this document for 10 years;
            </li>
            <li>
              stand by decisions taken by the previous editorial board to
              publish the article in case a new editorial board takes over.
