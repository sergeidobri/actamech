            To avoid conflicts of interest between authors, reviewers, members
            of the editorial board or editorial staff related to commercial
            issues, work or personal relationships that could affect their
            actions or judgment each party should act in line with publication

              The deputy editor or appointed secretary of the editorial board as
              instructed should pass the manuscript to another reviewer if the
              previously appointed reviewer has conflicts of interest with the
              author (collective of authors) or the organization the author
              represents;

              editorial staff;
            </li>
            <li>
              make information concerning conflicts of interest related to the
              article under consideration public if this information is not
              confidential and may affect the evaluation of the published
              article by readers and scholarly community;
            </li>
            <li>
              timely publish corrections and clarifications if the information
              about the conflict of interest was obtained after the article had
              been published.

            Authors (team of authors) are required to state their institutional
            affiliation and sources of their research funding related to the
            submitted manuscript. Reviewers are required to report the conflict
            of interest to the editor and decline to review the manuscript.

            The commitment to the above-mentioned publication ethics guidelines
            of all parties to the publication process (authors, reviewers,
            members of the editorial board editorial staff and editor-in-chief)
            would ensure the author`s intellectual property rights, better
            publication standards, promote research findings across audiences
            and eliminate the breach of authorship by the third party.
