            When submitting papers for publication in the «Acta Mechanica Et
            Imperium» individual authors (or a collective of authors) are
            required to:
          </p>
          <List>
            <li>
              demonstrate the significance of his/her (in case of more than one
              author – their) research, its practical implications, soundness of
              research findings and developed products;
            </li>
            <li>
              report reliable research findings where any resulting images
              (X-ray shots, photographs, script shots etc.) should not be edited
              or altered in any way;
            </li>
            <li>
              provide substantial information for peer-review and replication of
              results by other researchers;
            </li>
            <li>
              avoid fabrication and falsification of research findings and
              deliberate publication of erroneous or false materials;
            </li>
            <li>
              warrant that the article submitted for publication is an original
              work and that any abstracts, arguments, conclusions etc. presented
              in the research paper include reference to the primary data
              source;
            </li>
            <li>
              consider excessive use of borrowed material, any form of
              plagiarism including improperly documented quotations, paraphrases
              or copyright infringement unacceptable; avoid unnecessary
              fragmentation of the research into several manuscripts;
            </li>
            <li>
              acknowledge contributions of organisations and individuals

              the work;
            </li>
            <li>
              abide by ethical principles when reviewing and interpreting
              research conducted by other authors;
            </li>
            <li>
              enter only those individuals into the co-authors list who have
              made essential contribution into research, excluding those not
              involved;
            </li>
            <li>
              use information obtained privately from the third party only if

            </li>
            <li>
              consider it unacceptable to duplicate publications in several
              journals or publishing companies and cite a primary source when
              content from other publication has been reproduced;
            </li>
            <li>
              avoid submitting manuscripts that have already been published
              elsewhere;
            </li>
            <li>
              inform editors as soon as errors or inaccuracies have been
              detected regardless whether the paper is still under
              consideration, has been accepted or has already been published;
            </li>
            <li>
              be able to prove credibility of the original manuscript or correct
              mistakes and inaccuracies detected by reviewers or reported by the
              third party; conform to formatting requirements established by the
              editorial board and explained on the journal website;
            </li>
            <li>
              stand by decisions taken by the previous editorial board to
              publish the article in case a new editorial board takes over.
