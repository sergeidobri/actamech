        The journal serves as a leading international platform for scholars and
        engineers working at the intersection of mechanics, control theory,
        systems engineering, and advanced digital technologies, including big
        data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. The
        journal covers a broad spectrum of modern scientific disciplines,
        ranging from fundamental areas of mechanics to advanced topics in
        automatic control theory. It publishes innovative research contributing
        to the development of both theoretical foundations and practical
        applications in these rapidly evolving fields. Papers presenting recent
        advances in analytical models, computational algorithms, and
        experimental methods, including those enhanced by Artificial
        Intelligence and Big Data technologies, are highly encouraged.
